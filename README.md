# Dylan Gilgen

Hey, my name's Dylan.
I'm a student, teacher, brother, son, and much more!
This website is meant to serve as my e-portfolio. A way to share some of my projects and creations, and work towards a more digitally mininmal lifestyle.

## 🏗️🚧 UNDER CONSTRUCTION 🚧🏗️
The rest of this site is still under construction. You can track my progress here: https://github.com/dylangilgs/dylangilgs.github.io

Thanks,
Dylan
